Name                                     := Fazrah
Description                              := The Fazrah are a young species who are very prone to violent conflicts. They have survived this long solely on their tremendous luck.

Biological Description                   := The Fazrah are an aquatic species which must remain immersed in a salt-based liquid to survive. They are approximately 3 meters tall (if upright), and move through the use of 4 flippers at the bottom of their torso.  Their upper body is very humanoid with a head and two arm-like appendages.  The average lifespan of a Fazrah is 50 years.  
Society Description                      := The Fazrah are orginally from a violent aquatic world.  Most of the ocean they orginated from was filled with predatory species much larger then the Fazrah themselves.  Being under constant threat of attack has led the Fazrah to become a very diverse and violent culture.  The Fazrah society is very disjoint with many different factions operating independently.  The factions are often quite violent in their means.
General History Description              := The Fazrah do not have a collective history as such.  Normally moving in small groups, they have spread throughout the galaxy and are often hunted. Their violent and reclusive nature does not lend itself well to relations with other species. Their history is mainly dominated by their common usage as mercenaries for hire.

Name                                     := Drushocka
Description                              := The Drushoka are a silicon based lifeform that are physically strong and resistant to adverse conditions. They are not known for their intellectual abilities. 
Empire Name                              := Drushocka
Empire Type                              := Empire
Emperor Name                             := Fazrad
Emperor Title                            := Lord
Biological Description                   := The Drushocka evolved on a world very prone to intense lightning storms, probably resulting in their desire to control energy as best they can.  Physically they rather resemble greenish moss-covered boulders.  They move through the oscillation of these moss fibers along their bodies.  Suffice to say, they move very slow.  However, they make up for this in physical toughness.  Since they are predominantly composed of silicate based materials, they are literally as tough as rock. 
Society Description                      := It is believed that the Drushocka follow a dictatorial feudal system, with each lesser 'caste' swearing alliegence to a lord above it, and those lords swearing alliegence to a ruler who is chosen by the former ruler before he dies.  The Drushocka are best characterized as inflexible and straightfoward.  They see a goal, they move towards it and they attain it.
General History Description              := The Drushocka are the mortal enemies of the Eee.  The Drushocka employ energy-depleting devices as their weapons of choice.  Needless to say, they have an extremely adverse affect on the Eee, given that the Eee are composed primarily of energy.  The Eee firmly believe that the Drushocka ships are trying to eat them.

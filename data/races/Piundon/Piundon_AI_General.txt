Name                                     := Piundon
Description                              := The Piundon are a silicon based lifeform that is extremely violent. They have developed an advanced crystalline based technology.
Empire Name                              := Piundon
Empire Type                              := Empire
Emperor Name                             := Pira-sith
Emperor Title                            := Praetor
Biological Description                   := The Piundon are a silicon based lifeform that can reform their structure at will. Their bodies have a molecular structure in flux that can be made absolutely solid or in a semi-liquid form. Though they can control this physical change, they cannot hold the change for very long. Their reproduction takes place by dividing themselves into fourths, and then each piece becomes a new being while the original one dies. They have an average lifespan of 300 years at which time they reproduce. 
Society Description                      := The Piundon are organized into groups based on their occupation. Each group is at a higher level in society with the top level being the politicians. Many believe that the leaders of thier society keep their own people in line by continually waging war against nearby species. Though their people have numerous reasons to revolt, only one has ever been attempted. It was put down when that section of their planet was bombarded with radiation bombs. 
General History Description              := The Piundon have had a long history of violent wars against other species. They are not known to be very trustworthy as their leaders will use relations for a time, and then turn on their allies as soon as their usefulness ends. War is the only constant in the lives of the Piundon. Remarkably, they have kept their society together as they are usually victorious against these other species.

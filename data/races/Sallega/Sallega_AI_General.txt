Description                              := The Sallega are a race of emotionless drones that carry out the orders of their high council. They have attained Temporal technology.

Biological Description                   := The Sallega are a humanoid species that have evolved into a dual race. There are the highly intelligent ruling Salrasha, and the physically strong worker Salzalum. Both species are a pale beige color with a pasty skin and crystal blue eyes. Their average lifespan is 15 years for the workers, and 120 years for the intellectuals.  
Society Description                      := The Sallega have divided their society into two groups, the workers and the ruling intellectuals. The workers have very little intelligence, but follow their rulers as if they were their parents. They live only to serve the rulers of their world. The rulers are made up of an intellectual elite that govern absolutely. Though terribly unequal, their society seems to work. They have had no wars and the workers are very happy.
General History Description              := The Sallega have had no internal problems of note, but their reactions to other races have been mixed. The ruling elite, who are not used to being questioned, often have trouble relating to other species. They have a tendency to treat everyone else as their servants. Over the centuries, their race has become devoted to gaining a large stake of territory throughout the galaxy. This goal has been greatly furthered by their recent discovery of temporal technology.

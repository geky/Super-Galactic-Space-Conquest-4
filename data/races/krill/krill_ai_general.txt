Name                                     := Krill
Description                              := The Krill are a genocidal race which are violent in the extreme. They reproduce quickly and are adept at building things.
Empire Name                              := Krill
Empire Type                              := Dominion
Emperor Name                             := Ulrok
Emperor Title                            := Lord
Biological Description                   := The Krill resemble a cross between a bird and a reptile. Many scientists believe that they are an intelligent species of dinosaur that evolved within a carbon dioxide atmosphere. They stand roughly 3 meters tall and are bi-pedal with 2 tails. The Krill have the remnants of wings, but they are unusable. Their average life span is approximately 40 years, but because of the elder culling, very few make it past 20 years. The Krill reproduce through the laying of 10-20 eggs a year.
Society Description                      := The Krill are driven by the philosophy of natural selection. Their society is completely drive by the concept that the strongest are meant to survive, and that all others must perish to make room. They perform ritual elder culling where they kill all of their elders who have grown too weak to defend themselves. Their young are taught early on that they must fight to survive. Their society is highly factionalized with a dominant ruler coming to power only in the last 50 years. At present, they have resolved their internal strife by refocusing on being superior to the aliens they encounter.
General History Description              := The Krill have always been a violent species. They are renowned for utterly destroying the Basrah Empire without ever actually having talked with them. They deem most aliens to be inferior and rarely make alliances. With the rise of their high lord, the race seems to be united for the first time. The past 50 years have shown a desire for territorial expansion, military conquest, and just about anything to keep them distracted from the days of their own internal conflicts.
